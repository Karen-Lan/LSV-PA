## API Used

* `Abc_NtkToDar()`: convert `Aig_Man_t` to `Abc_Ntk_t` network.
* `Cnf_Derive()`: derive cnf formula `Cnf_Dat_t` from `Aig_Man_t`.
* `Cnf_DataDup()` and `Cnf_DataLift()`: first duplicate original cnf into a fresh copy and than shift variables to combine two sets of cnf formulas.

* `Cnf_DataWriteIntoSolver()`: 
* `sat_solver_addvar()`: used to add enable variables.
* `sat_solver_setnvars()`: make sat solver depend on larger set of variables.
* `sat_solver_addclause()`: used to add clauses to control PI and PO to be positive or negative.
* `sat_solver_solve()`: perform sat solving.


## approach

### incremental sat solving

* switch between `positive unate test` and `negative unate test`: lets say the original cnf var we want to cofactor now is x, and the copied cnf's variable is x*, we can switch between 2 testing by setting x = 1, x* = 0, and change to x = 0, x* = 1 to preform another unateness test.

* switch between different PIs: when we want to cofactor PI x, we need to change its enable variable to let x, x* able to have different value, while other PI's enable variable will make other PI var values be the same.
